timecard.py:
    a simple timecard / clocking program.

    i was inspired by a ruby program i saw on hacker news (INSERT REF HERE).

    what does it do better and why rewrite it?
    basically, i wanted the ability to keep track of which project i was
    and the ability to report statistics per-project.


usage spec:
    tc <project>    clock in or out of project
    tc ?            am i clocked in?
    tc --time       basic statistics on time spent
    tc --report <week|month|year> 
                    report statistics based on time period
    tc -h           prints usage
    tc --log        show timecard log

implemented:
    tc <project>
    tc ?
    tc --time <project>
    tc --log
